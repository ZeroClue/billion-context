 * opencode `x-opencode-session`, Responses body `session_id` /
 * `metadata.session_id`, `prompt_cache_key`, ...), and that value is the only

 * mutable mid-conversation and must not break session continuity (#280, #286):
 * credentials rotate (ChatGPT OAuth bearers), users switch relays/upstreams,
 * and the wire protocol itself can change (relay translation, cross-protocol
 * model switches).
 *
 * A protocol switch is safe under one id because session state is
 * protocol-neutral (kernel-normalized CompressionState, text block contents,
 * CoreMessage snapshots) and the client re-sends the full history every turn,
 * where the current protocol's adapter re-normalizes it.
 *
 * Requests WITHOUT a client-provided identity are rejected with 400 by the
 * server: the content-fingerprint fallback has a real collision surface and
 * would silently orphan state, so anonymous requests fail explicitly instead.
 *
 * The id is used ONLY inside the proxy (compression-state store, persistence,
 * UI label). It is NEVER sent upstream — if a per-conversation signal is
 * needed for upstream routing, use `affinityToken()` below.

 * share one conversation id (Codex threads reuse the task-level session id,
 * #150). For clients whose native conversation id is persona-scoped — one id is
 * minted per persona, so an id can never be reused across personas — the same
 * id carrying different instructions mid-conversation means "same persona,
 * updated system context" (opencode's system-context reconcile after an
 * AGENTS.md edit), not a new persona. Fingerprinting there forks an orphan
 * |sub:<fp> session and resets all compression state.
 *
 * Trust set (each verified against the client's own source):
 *  - x-session-affinity with a ses_… value / x-opencode-session: opencode stamps
 *    its session id on every model request and mints a fresh child session id
 *    for every task-tool subagent (sessions.create({ parentID })).
 *  - x-bili-plugin-conversation + x-bili-plugin-instructions-mutable: 1 — the
 *    plugin declares its host's conversation ids are persona-scoped. Only the
 *    opencode plugin stamps the declaration today; unverified hosts (dsh,
 *    hermes, …) stay on the fingerprinted path.
 *
 * Everything else deliberately keeps the fingerprint: Codex body/header/metadata
 * session ids (#150), x-claude-code-session-id (Claude subagents SHARE the main
 * agent's session id, #970), grok/mcode/generic x-session-id, prompt-cache-key.

 * for spawned agent threads) and `thread_id`. Subagent threads REUSE the

 * of one task onto a single session — subagents inherit the root's
 * compression state, which breaks #150's isolation (a guardian subagent must
 * read the user's original authorization verbatim, never a compressed
 * summary).
 *
 * When the metadata is present AND cross-checked (metadata.thread_id ===
 * `thread-id` header), partition by thread_source:
 *   - "user"     → undefined (validated, but the id resolves through the
 *                  legacy precedence chain — binding the session-id header
 *                  directly would leapfrog stronger headers such as
 *                  x-bili-plugin-conversation and flip the identity when a

 *                  chain reads the same session-id header for plain codex
 *                  traffic, so the root value is unchanged)
 *   - anything else → the `thread-id` header (fresh independent state per
 *                  thread; self-contained replay is lossless). codex's
 *                  ThreadSource serializes more than user/subagent —

 *                  session, every other source gets its own thread state.

/**
 * Claude Code subagent split (#970).
 *
 * Claude Code stamps the SAME `x-claude-code-session-id` on every model
 * request of a session — including requests made by Task-tool subagents —
 * so the identity chain maps main turn and all subagents onto ONE session.
 * Every request then serializes on that session's lock (withSessionLock
 * covers prepare + forward + the streamed response), and a slow subagent
 * first request head-of-line-blocks the main turn (and vice versa) for the
 * full upstream latency.
 *
 * Discrimination is two-signal, both verified against live Claude Code
 * 2.1.274 traffic (`-p` mode AND custom agent types like Explore):
 *
 * 1. HEADER: the request carries `x-claude-code-agent-id` and/or
 *    `x-claude-code-parent-agent-id`. Main-turn requests carry agent-id only
 *    from their second request on (the very first request and side requests
 *    like title generation carry neither), so the header alone can't decide —
 *    the parent header is NOT reliable (general-purpose `-p` subagents send
 *    it, custom agent types like Explore do not).
 *
 * 2. SYSTEM: the MAIN agent's system always contains a block starting with
 *    one of the MAIN_SYSTEM_PREFIXES ("You are Claude Code…" for interactive
 *    sessions, "You are an interactive agent…" for -p/SDK sessions), while a
 *    subagent's system blocks are its agent definition ("This session is a
 *    background job…", "You are a file search specialist for…", …) — no
 *    stable positive marker exists across agent types, so the check is
 *    negative: none of the main prefixes may match.
 *
 * A request splits only when BOTH signals say subagent (header present AND
 * no main prefix in system). Failure modes degrade in the safe direction:
 * if a future Claude Code rewords its main prompts, subagents stop being
 * split (back to today's serial behavior) — the main session can never be
 * mis-split, because its prefixes are the gate and its system legitimately
 * mutates turn to turn without ever losing the prefix block.
 *
 * Split sessions keep per-subagent compression state (a subagent is its own
 * conversation; isolation matches the codex #316/#150 semantics) and get
 * their own lock chain, so subagents stop queueing behind the main turn.
 * The namespace format mirrors subagentNamespace's `<id>|sub:<hash>` on the
 * Responses branch. Clients without these headers (older Claude Code, other
 * agents, curl) are untouched.
